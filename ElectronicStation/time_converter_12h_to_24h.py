"""
You are the modern man who prefers the 24-hour time format. But the 12-hour format is used in some places. Your task is to 
convert the time from the 12-h format into 24-h by following the next rules:
- the output format should be 'hh:mm'
- if the output hour is less than 10 - write '0' before it. For example: '09:05'
Here you can find some useful information about the 12-hour format.


Input: Time in a 12-hour format (as a string).

Output: Time in a 24-hour format (as a string).
